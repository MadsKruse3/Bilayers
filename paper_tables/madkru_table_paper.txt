	\caption{The table contains comparisons between 
            our results for madkru with those found elsewhere in literature. The columns contain: 
            bilayer stacking types, binding energy using the, order of stability found in the reference paper,
            lattice constants, interlayer distances measured between the same atoms in the middle of each layer, 
            magnetic configurations as well as the interlayer exchange constant computed in this work.}
